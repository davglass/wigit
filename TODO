Currently working on moving the code to a more object oriented approach and only supporting PHP5.

Current working class:  class.git.php (does the basics)
                        test.git.php (test page for git class)


Goals for this project:

    Multi-Language support per page
    Authentication abstraction class
        MySQL
        sqlite
        htaccess

    Macros
    Plugins
    Themes
    Permissions
    Better Wiki/Twiki parser
