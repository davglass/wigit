* WiGit II: A Git-based Wiki *
***************************

About
-----
WiGit II is a simple Wiki written in PHP, using Git (http://git.or.cz/) as 
a backend for tracking changes. Besides Git, this wiki makes use of PEAR::Text::Wiki
for marking up text. 


Features
--------
* Very simple and light
* Easily customizable using themes
* Extensive syntax for marking up text (using PEAR::Text::Wiki::*)
* Full history tracking support
* Support for pretty URLs (using URL rewriting)


Requirements
------------
* Webserver
* PHP5
* Git


Installation
------------
* Put the WiGit dir in some place where the webserver can find it
* Install the required Pear modules:
        pear install Text_Wiki
        pear install Text_Wiki_Mediawiki-0.1.0
        pear install Text_Wiki_BBCode-0.0.4

* Make sure there's a 'data' subdir, and that it is writable by the webserver
* Copy config.php.sample to config.php, and edit config.php to reflect your 
  local settings
* Surf to the wigit URL, and you should start by editing the front page

For URL rewriting, change the SCRIPT_URL to be the base URL prefix (as 
is shown in the config file), and add the necessary URL rewrite rules for
your webserver. E.g.,
* For Apache, add the following to .htaccess in your wigit install dir:
		<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
			RewriteEngine On
			RewriteBase /wigit/
			RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
            RewriteRule ^/wigit/themes/(.*) %{REQUEST_URI} [L]
			RewriteRule (.*) /wigit/index.php?r=$1 [L] 
		</IfModule>
* For lighttpd, add the following to your config file:
    url.rewrite-once (       
        "^/wigit/templates/(.*)" => "$0",
        "^/wigit(.*)" => "/wigit/index.php?r=$1",
      )
(where /wigit is replaced by your own base url)
